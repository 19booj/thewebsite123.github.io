# The Website
From now on all changes to www.thewebsite123.net63.net will be changed using this repository https://github.com/Eviper01/Eviper01.github.io

This means that all changes will be tested on the beta version of the site http://www.eviper01.github.io/ before being uploaded to the website


What this means:
We will be able to see what user changes what in real time and the website is now completly open source!
